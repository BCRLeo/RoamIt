## Frontend
### Project Setup
Create the React project with Vite by running
```npm create vite@latest```
Select React, then TypeScript.

Next, run
```
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```
to install the dependencies.

Finally, run
```npm install @mui/material @emotion/react @emotion/styled```
to install the Material UI design library.

### Running and building
Open the `frontend` directory with
```cd fronted```
To start a local development server with live updates, run the script
```npx vite```
To build the React project into a static site for production, run the script
```npx build``` --- wrong, I think
```npm run build``` This should be the right one
